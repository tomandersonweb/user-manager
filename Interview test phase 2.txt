***********The App************
The app is a list of users, you can view multiple pages of users and favourite users that you want to favourite.



Plase 2 - Some changes and additions: 

* The header rectangle at the top needs to be a different colour - #60edf8  - to be precise.
Updated the css file. 


* The Favourite buttons weren't working after you switch pages. Please fix this if you haven't already. Why was this the case? How would you commit this data to the server?
The Jquery events were not being re-bound after the partial view updates. Added function binding to success callback of Ajax call. 
Favourites passed to a function and onto the service. 



* Operators are clicking the favourite button for the wrong user - implement something which will reduce the chance of this happening
Hightlighted row that has been edited. 



* The Operators need to be able to assign a user to one of three teams ("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma"). Do this in a way that will also facilitate other team management additions in the future - make sure that this change is being sent to the server and that it is being commited to a service - the user service is not a suitable place for any team accessing or manipulation to happen. If you are struggling for time then a brief runover how you would do this will suffice.
